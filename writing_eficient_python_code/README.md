# Writing Efficient Python Code

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/writing-efficient-python-code)

## [Foundations for Efficiencies](./01_best_practices/)

In this chapter, you'll learn what it means to write efficient Python code. You'll explore Python's Standard Library, learn about NumPy arrays, and practice using some of Python's built-in tools. This chapter builds a foundation for the concepts covered ahead. 


## [Timing and Profiling Code](./02_timing_and_profiling_code/)

In this chapter, you will learn how to gather and compare runtimes between different coding approaches. You'll practice using the line_profiler and memory_profiler packages to profile your code base and spot bottlenecks. Then, you'll put your learnings to practice by replacing these bottlenecks with efficient Python code. 


## [Gaining Eficiencies](./03_gaining_efficiencies/)

This chapter covers more complex efficiency tips and tricks. You'll learn a few useful built-in modules for writing efficient code and practice using set theory. You'll then learn about looping patterns in Python and how to make them more efficient. 


## [Basic Pandas Optimizations](./04_basic_pandas_optimizations/)

This chapter offers a brief introduction on how to efficiently work with pandas DataFrames. You'll learn the various options you have for iterating over a DataFrame. Then, you'll learn how to efficiently apply functions to data stored in a DataFrame.
