# Hypothesis Testing in Python

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/hypothesis-testing-in-python)

Hypothesis testing lets you answer questions about your datasets in a statistically rigorous way. In this course, you'll grow your Python analytical skills as you learn how and when to use common tests like t-tests, proportion tests, and chi-square tests. Working with real-world data, including Stack Overflow user feedback and supply-chain data for medical supply shipments, you'll gain a deep understanding of how these tests work and the key assumptions that underpin them. You'll also discover how non-parametric tests can be used to go beyond the limitations of traditional hypothesis tests.

## [Introduction to Hypothesis Testing](./01_introduction_to_hypothesis_testing/)

How does hypothesis testing work and what problems can it solve? To find out, you’ll walk through the workflow for a one sample proportion test. In doing so, you'll encounter important concepts like z-scores, p-values, and false negative and false positive errors. 

## [Two-Sample and ANOVA Tests](./02_two_sample_and_anova_tests/)

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to test for differences in means between two groups using t-tests and extend this to more than two groups using ANOVA and pairwise t-tests. 

## [Proportion Tests](./03_proportion_tests/)

Now it’s time to test for differences in proportions between two groups using proportion tests. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll extend your proportion tests to more than two groups with chi-square independence tests, and return to the one sample case with chi-square goodness of fit tests. 

## [Non-Parametric Tests](./04_non_parametric_tests/)

Finally, it’s time to learn about the assumptions made by parametric hypothesis tests, and see how non-parametric tests can be used when those assumptions aren't met.
