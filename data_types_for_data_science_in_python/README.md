# Data Types for Data Science in Python

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-types-for-data-science-in-python)

Have you got your basic Python programming chops down for Data Science but are yearning for more? Then this is the course for you. Herein, you'll consolidate and practice your knowledge of lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and date times. You'll see their relevance in working with lots of real data and how to leverage several of them in concert to solve multistep problems, including an extended case study using Chicago metropolitan area transit data. You'll also learn how to use many of the objects in the Python Collections module, which will allow you to store and manipulate your data for a variety of Data Scientific purposes. After taking this course, you'll be ready to tackle many Data Science challenges Pythonically. 


## [Fundamental Sequence Data Types](./01_fundamental_sequence_data_types/)

This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental Python data types - lists, sets, and strings. These data containers are critical as they provide the basis for storing and looping over ordered data. To make things interesting, you'll apply what you learn about these types to answer questions about the New York Baby Names dataset!  

## [Dictionaries - The Root of Python](./02_dictionaries_the_root_of_python/)

At the root of all things Python is a dictionary. Herein, you'll learn how to use them to safely handle data that can viewed in a variety of ways to answer even more questions about the New York Baby Names dataset. You'll explore how to loop through data in a dictionary, access nested data, add new data, and come to appreciate all of the wonderful capabilities of Python dictionaries.  

## [Numeric Data Types, Booleans, and Sets](./03_numeric_data_types_booleans_and_sets/)

Let's take a step away from dictionaries and look at some other common numeric and boolean data types along with sets.  

## [Advanced Data Types](./04_advanced_data_types/) - no slides available

Some data types are composites of other data types and give me even more capabilities than a fundamental data type. Let's explore a few complex types from the collections module and data classes.
