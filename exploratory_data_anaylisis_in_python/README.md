# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python)

So you’ve got some interesting data - where do you begin your analysis? This course will cover the process of exploring and analyzing data, from understanding what’s included in a dataset to incorporating exploration findings into a data science workflow.

Using data on unemployment figures and plane ticket prices, you’ll leverage Python to summarize and validate data, calculate, identify and replace missing values, and clean both numerical and categorical values. Throughout the course, you’ll create beautiful Seaborn visualizations to understand variables and their relationships.

For example, you’ll examine how alcohol use and student performance are related. Finally, the course will show how exploratory findings feed into data science workflows by creating new features, balancing categorical features, and generating hypotheses from findings.

By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence to perform your own exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.You’ll be able to explain your findings visually to others and suggest the next steps for gathering insights from your data! 


## [Getting to Know a Dataset](./01_getting_to_know_a_dataset/)

What's the best way to approach a new dataset? Learn to validate and summarize categorical and numerical data and create Seaborn visualizations to communicate your findings. 

## [Data Cleaning and Imputation](./02_data_cleaning_and_imputation/)

Exploring and analyzing data often means dealing with missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers. In this chapter, you’ll learn techniques to handle these issues and streamline your EDA processes! 

## [Relationships in Data](./03_relationships_in_data/)

Variables in datasets don't exist in a vacuum; they have relationships with each other. In this chapter, you'll look at relationships across numerical, categorical, and even DateTime data, exploring the direction and strength of these relationships as well as ways to visualize them. 

## [Turning Exploratory Analysis into Action](./04_turning_exploratory_analysis_into_action/)

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial step in the data science workflow, but it isn't the end! Now it's time to learn techniques and considerations you can use to successfully move forward with your projects after you've finished exploring!
