# Developing Python Packages

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/developing-python-packages)

Do you find yourself copying and pasting the same code between files, wishing it was easier to reuse and share your awesome snippets? Wrapping your code into Python packages can help! In this course, you’ll learn about package structure and the extra files needed to turn loose code into convenient packages. You'll also learn about import structure, documentation, and how to maintain code style using flake8. You’ll then speed up your package development by building templates, using cookiecutter to create package skeletons. Finally, you'll learn how to use setuptools and twine to build and publish your packages to PyPI—the world stage for Python packages. 


## [From Loose Code to Local Package](./01_from_loose_code_to_local_package/)

Get your package started by converting scripts you have already written. You'll create a simple package which you can use on your own computer.  

## [Install Your Package from Anywhere](./02_install_your_package_from_anywhere/)

Make your package installable for yourself and others. In this chapter, you'll learn to deal with dependencies, write READMEs, and include licenses. You'll also complete all the steps to publish your package on PyPI—the main home of Python packages.  

## [Increasing Your Package Quality](./03_increasing_your_package_quality/)

Bring your package up to a professional standard. Discover how to use pytest to guard against errors, tox to test if your package functions with multiple versions of Python, and flake8 to maintain great code style. 

## [Rapid Package Development](./04_rapid_package_development/)

Create your packages more quickly. In this final chapter, you’ll learn how to use cookiecutter to generate all the supporting files your package needs, Makefiles to simplify releasing new versions, and be introduced to the last few files your package needs to attract users and contributors.
