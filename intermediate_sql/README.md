SQL is the most popular language for turning raw data stored in a database into actionable insights. Using a database of films made around the world, this course covers:

✓ How to filter and compare data
✓ How to use aggregate functions to summarize data
✓ How to sort and group your data
✓ How to present your data cleanly using tools such as rounding and aliasing

Accompanied at every step with hands-on practice queries, this course teaches you everything you need to know to analyze data using your own SQL code today!

## [Selecting Data](./01_selecting_data/)

In this first chapter, you’ll learn how to query a films database and select the data needed to answer questions about the movies and actors. You'll also understand how SQL code is executed and formatted. 


## [Filtering Records](./02_filtering_records)

Learn about how you can filter numerical and textual data with SQL. Filtering is an important use for this language. You’ll learn how to use new keywords and operators to help you narrow down your query to get results that meet your desired criteria and gain a better understanding of NULL values and how to handle them. 


## [Aggregate Functions](./03_aggregate_functions/)

SQL allows you to zoom in and out to better understand an entire dataset, its subsets, and its individual records. You'll learn to summarize data using aggregate functions and perform basic arithmetic calculations inside queries to gain insights into what makes a successful film. 


## [Sorting and Grouping](./04_sorting_and_grouping/)

This final chapter teaches you how to sort and group data. These skills will take your analyses to a new level by helping you uncover critical business insights and identify trends and performance. You'll get hands-on experience to determine which films performed the best and how movie durations and budgets changed over time.
