# Analyzing Data in Spreadsheets

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-data-in-spreadsheets)

This course will dig deeper into some of the core functionality of Google Sheets. There's a whole bunch of predefined functions we'll cover, like `SUM()` and `AVERAGE()`, and `VLOOKUP()`. We'll apply these techniques to do some analysis on your grades in school, look at performance statistics within a company, track monthly sales, and look at some real geographical information about the countries of the world. 


## [Predefined functions](./01_predefined_functions/)

This chapter introduces a very useful feature in Google Sheets: predefined functions. You'll use these functions to solve complex problems without having to worry about specific calculations. We’ll cover a lot of predefined functions, including functions for numbers, functions for strings, and functions for dates. 

## [Conditional functions and lookups](./02_conditional_funstions_and_lookups/)

In the last chapter of the course, you'll master more advanced functions like IF() and VLOOKUP(). Conditional and lookup functions won’t seem so scary after you completed this chapter.
