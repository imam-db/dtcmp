# Sampling in Python

[link course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/sampling-in-python)

Sampling in Python is the cornerstone of inference statistics and hypothesis testing. It's a powerful skill used in survey analysis and experimental design to draw conclusions without surveying an entire population. In this Sampling in Python course, you’ll discover when to use sampling and how to perform common types of sampling—from simple random sampling to more complex methods like stratified and cluster sampling. Using real-world datasets, including coffee ratings, Spotify songs, and employee attrition, you’ll learn to estimate population statistics and quantify uncertainty in your estimates by generating sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions. 


## [Introduction to Sampling](./01_introduction_to_sampling/)

Learn what sampling is and why it is so powerful. You’ll also learn about the problems caused by convenience sampling and the differences between true randomness and pseudo-randomness.

## [Sampling Methods](./02_sampling_methods/)

It’s time to get hands-on and perform the four random sampling methods in Python: simple, systematic, stratified, and cluster. 

## [Sampling Distributions](./03_sampling_distributions/)

Let’s test your sampling. In this chapter, you’ll discover how to quantify the accuracy of sample statistics using relative errors, and measure variation in your estimates by generating sampling distributions. 

## [Bootstrap Distributions](./04_bootstrap_distributions/)

You’ll get to grips with resampling to perform bootstrapping and estimate variation in an unknown population. You’ll learn the difference between sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions using resampling.
