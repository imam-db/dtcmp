#### Gain an Introduction to Docker
Docker is a tool used to develop, run, and ship containers. It’s an essential part of every data professional’s toolbelt, helping to create robust, secure, and scalable applications or workflows. In this course, you’ll become a Docker pro, gaining hands-on experience using Docker CLI.

#### Explore the Docker Basics
Learn the Docker basics and understand how to create and manage containers using Dockerfiles and instructions. After an introduction to containers and when they are useful, you’ll learn the Docker terminology and get hands-on experience with Docker commands using the Docker Command Line Interface.

#### Learn About Docker Containers & Images
As you progress, you’ll learn how to create and manage Docker containers using Dockerfiles and Dockerfile instructions. To wrap up, you’ll learn Docker image security best practices to make your images safe and secure. 


## [What is Docker](./01_what_is_docker/)

You’ll start this course with an introduction to containers, what they are, their uses, and their advantages. You'll learn about Docker Engine, Docker’s tool to create, run and manage containers. Then you’ll learn the difference between a container and an image and compare containers and virtual machines, learning about their differences.

## [Using Docker Containers](./02_using_docker_containers/)

In chapter 2, you'll go from starting and stopping your first container to seeing how to clean your environment by removing all containers and images. You'll see how to debug issues by running commands inside a container or executing bash commands in a container interactively. Afterward, you'll know how to share images with colleagues or your entire company. All of this using the Docker Command Line Interface. 

## [Writing Your Own Docker Images](./03_writing_your_own_docker_images/)

Once you are able to manage images and containers, it’s time to create your own. In chapter 3, you’ll build your own images using Dockerfiles. Dockerfiles are text files that include everything needed for Docker to build an image. You’ll learn how to create images and will get an introduction to all the essential Dockerfile instructions like FROM, RUN, COPY, and more. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have insight into how Docker makes images and be able to create optimized Docker images from scratch. 

## [Creating Secure Docker Images](./04_creating_secure_docker_images/)

In this final chapter, you’ll focus on making your Dockerfiles configurable and secure. You'll learn how to make your Dockerfiles configurable using the ARG and ENV instructions. You’ll see why changing the user in your images makes them more secure and how to use the USER Dockerfile instruction to do so. To wrap things up, you’ll learn about some essential security best practices when creating Docker Images.
